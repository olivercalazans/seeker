If you don't have Cargo installed, follow the steps on the [official Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

All dependencies are managed by Cargo, so there's no need to install them manually.  
You can find them in the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/olivercalazans/seeker/blob/main/Cargo.toml) file.
